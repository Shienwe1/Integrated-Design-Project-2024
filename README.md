  This repository contains all the code and resources needed to run the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for automated waste classification. It supports training on custom datasets, real-time inference, and integration with smart waste management systems. The model is designed to identify and classify different types of waste materials (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic) to enable efficient sorting and recycling.
