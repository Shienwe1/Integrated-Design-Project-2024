Integrated Design Project 2024
  
  This repository contains all the code and resources needed to run the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for automated waste classification. It supports training on custom datasets, real-time inference, and integration with smart waste management systems. The model is designed to identify and classify different types of waste materials (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic) to enable efficient sorting and recycling.

GPIO pin for sensors and motors:
1. Ultrasonic sensor (Trig: 17, Echoe: 27)
2. SG90 Servo Motor (23)
3. MG995 Servo Motor (18, 24)
